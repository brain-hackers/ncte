ncte - ncurses terminal emulator

   a small demonstration of an ncurses based terminal emulator
   using libvterm (https://code.launchpad.net/~leonerd/libvterm)


compilation:

   the make file will use the bzr utility to checkout a copy of libvterm
   from launchpad, so if you dont have bzr installed you have to create
   the ./libvterm directory with all the required contents in some other
   way.
